"1","The Sample Average Approximation Method for Solving Two-Stage Stochastic Programs with Endogenous Uncertainty","Maria Bazotte, Margarida Carvalho, Thibaut Vidal","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","Real-world decision-making problems involve Type 1 decision-dependent uncertainty, where the probability distribution of the stochastic process depends on the model decisions. However, few studies focus on two-stage stochastic programs with this type of endogenous uncertainty, and those that do lack general methodologies. We thus propose herein a general method for solving a class of these programs based on the transformation of random variables, a technique widely employed in probability and statistics. The proposed method is tailored to large-scale problems with discrete or continuous endogenous random variables. The random variable transformation allows the use of the sample average approximation (SAA) method, which provides optimality convergence guarantees under certain conditions. We show that, for some classical distributions, the proposed method reduces to solving mixed-integer linear or convex programs. Finally, we validate this method by applying it to a network design and facility-protection problem, considering distinct decision-dependent distributions for the random variables. Whereas most distributions result in a nonlinear nonconvex deterministic equivalent program, the proposed method solves mixed-integer linear programs in all cases. In addition, it produces attractive performance estimators for the SAA method in a reasonable computational time and outperforms the case in which the endogenous distribution defines a mixed-integer deterministic equivalent.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:26:16 UTC (86 KB)"
"2","Dynamical systems of an infinite-dimensional non-linear operator","U.R. Olimov, U.A. Rozikov","Dynamical Systems (math.DS)","We investigate discrete-time dynamical systems generated by an infinite-dimensional non-linear operator that maps the Banach space $l_1$ to itself. It is demonstrated that this operator possesses up to seven fixed points. By leveraging the specific form of our operator, we illustrate that analyzing the operator can be simplified to a two-dimensional approach. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description of all fixed points, invariant sets for the two-dimensional operator and determine the set of limit points for its trajectories. These results are then applied to find the set of limit points for trajectories generated by the infinite-dimensional operator.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:15:30 UTC (18 KB)"

In 2017, Nikiforov defined the $A_\alpha$-matrix of $G$, $A_\alpha(G)$, as a linear convex combination of $A(G)$ and $D(G)$, the following way, $A_\alpha(G):=\alpha A(G)+(1-\alpha)D(G),$ where $\alpha\in[0,1]$. In this paper, we present some bounds for the eigenvalues of $A_\alpha(G)$ and for the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A_\alpha(l(G))$. Extremal graphs attaining some of these bounds are characterized.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:01:35 UTC (549 KB)"
"4","High-order accurate positivity-preserving and well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin schemes for ten-moment Gaussian closure equations with source terms","Jiangfu Wang, Huazhong Tang, Kailiang Wu","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","This paper proposes novel high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for the one- and two-dimensional ten-moment Gaussian closure equations with source terms defined by a known potential function. Our DG schemes exhibit the desirable capability of being well-balanced (WB) for a known hydrostatic equilibrium state while simultaneously preserving positive density and positive-definite anisotropic pressure tensor. The well-balancedness is built on carefully modifying the solution states in the Harten-Lax-van Leer-contact (HLLC) flux, and appropriate reformulation and discretization of the source terms. Our novel modification technique overcomes the difficulties posed by the anisotropic effects, maintains the high-order accuracy, and ensures that the modified solution state remains within the physically admissible state set. Positivity-preserving analyses of our WB DG schemes are conducted by using several key properties of the admissible state set, the HLLC flux and the HLLC solver, as well as the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach in [Wu & Shu, SIAM Review, 65: 1031-1073, 2023], which was originally applied to analyze the admissible state set and physical-constraints-preserving schemes for the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in [Wu & Tang, M3AS, 27: 1871-1928, 2017], to address the difficulties arising from the nonlinear constraints on pressure tensor. Moreover, the proposed WB DG schemes satisfy the weak positivity for the cell averages, implying the use of a scaling limiter to enforce the physical admissibility of the DG solution polynomials at certain points of interest. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the preservation of equilibrium states, accuracy in capturing small perturbations to such states, robustness in solving problems involving low density or low pressure, and high resolution for both smooth and discontinuous solutions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:16:02 UTC (8,227 KB)"
"5","Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras","Cédric Arhancet","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermions algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ and more generally the Cantor group. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:58:31 UTC (59 KB)"
"6","GQL-Based Bound-Preserving and Locally Divergence-Free Central Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics","Shengrong Ding, Kailiang Wu","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","This paper develops novel and robust central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) schemes of arbitrarily high-order accuracy for special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) with a general equation of state (EOS). These schemes are provably bound-preserving (BP), i.e., consistently preserve the upper bound for subluminal fluid velocity and the positivity of density and pressure, while also (locally) maintaining the divergence-free (DF) constraint for the magnetic field. For 1D RMHD, the standard CDG method is exactly DF, and its BP property is proven under a condition achievable by BP limiter. For 2D RMHD, we design provably BP and locally DF CDG schemes based on the suitable discretization of a modified RMHD system. A key novelty in our schemes is the discretization of additional source terms in the modified RMHD equations, so as to precisely counteract the influence of divergence errors on the BP property across overlapping meshes. We provide rigorous proofs of the BP property for our CDG schemes and first establish the theoretical connection between BP and discrete DF properties on overlapping meshes for RMHD. Owing to the absence of explicit expressions for primitive variables in terms of conserved variables, the constraints of physical bounds are strongly nonlinear, making the BP proofs highly nontrivial. We overcome these challenges through technical estimates within the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) framework, which converts the nonlinear constraints into linear ones. Furthermore, we introduce a new 2D cell average decomposition on overlapping meshes, which relaxes the theoretical BP CFL constraint and reduces the number of internal nodes, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the 2D BP CDG method. We implement the proposed CDG schemes for extensive RMHD problems with various EOSs, demonstrating their robustness and effectiveness in challenging scenarios.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:56:01 UTC (9,672 KB)"
"7","On Minimal Depth in Neural Networks","Juan L. Valerdi","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","A characterization of the representability of neural networks is relevant to comprehend their success in artificial intelligence. This study investigate two topics on ReLU neural network expressivity and their connection with a conjecture related to the minimum depth required for representing any continuous piecewise linear function (CPWL). The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate several fundamental properties, deriving results equivalent to those of ReLU networks, such as depth inclusions and depth computation from vertices. Notably, we compute the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:34:03 UTC (17 KB)"
"8","Generative Modelling with Tensor Train approximations of Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations","David Sommer, Robert Gruhlke, Max Kirstein, Martin Eigel, Claudia Schillings","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","Sampling from probability densities is a common challenge in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Generative Modelling (GM). In GM in particular, the use of reverse-time diffusion processes depending on the log-densities of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward processes are a popular sampling tool. In Berner et al. [2022] the authors point out that these log-densities can be obtained by solution of a \textit{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman} (HJB) equation known from stochastic optimal control. While this HJB equation is usually treated with indirect methods such as policy iteration and unsupervised training of black-box architectures like Neural Networks, we propose instead to solve the HJB equation by direct time integration, using compressed polynomials represented in the Tensor Train (TT) format for spatial discretization. Crucially, this method is sample-free, agnostic to normalization constants and can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to the TT compression. We provide a complete derivation of the HJB equation's action on Tensor Train polynomials and demonstrate the performance of the proposed time-step-, rank- and degree-adaptive integration method on a nonlinear sampling task in 20 dimensions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:30:20 UTC (1,986 KB)"
"9","A unified constraint formulation of immersed body techniques for coupled fluid-solid motion: continuous equations and numerical algorithms","Amneet Pal Singh Bhalla, Neelesh A. Patankar","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","Numerical simulation of moving immersed solid bodies in fluids is now practiced routinely following pioneering work of Peskin and co-workers on immersed boundary method (IBM), Glowinski and co-workers on fictitious domain method (FDM), and others on related methods. A variety of variants of IBM and FDM approaches have been published, most of which rely on using a background mesh for the fluid equations and tracking the solid body using Lagrangian points. The key idea that is common to these methods is to assume that the entire fluid-solid domain is a fluid and then to constrain the fluid within the solid domain to move in accordance with the solid governing equations. The immersed solid body can be rigid or deforming. Thus, in all these methods the fluid domain is extended into the solid domain. In this review, we provide a mathemarical perspective of various immersed methods by recasting the governing equations in an extended domain form for the fluid. The solid equations are used to impose appropriate constraints on the fluid that is extended into the solid domain. This leads to extended domain constrained fluid-solid governing equations that provide a unified framework for various immersed body techniques. The unified constrained governing equations in the strong form are independent of the temporal or spatial discretization schemes. We show that particular choices of time stepping and spatial discretization lead to different techniques reported in literature ranging from freely moving rigid to elastic self-propelling bodies. These techniques have wide ranging applications including aquatic locomotion, underwater vehicles, car aerodynamics, and organ physiology (e.g. cardiac flow, esophageal transport, respiratory flows), wave energy convertors, among others. We conclude with comments on outstanding challenges and future directions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:48:07 UTC (1,392 KB)"
"10","The Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method with stage-dependent polynomial spaces for hyperbolic conservation laws","Qifan Chen, Zheng Sun, Yulong Xing","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","In this paper, we present a novel class of high-order Runge--Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The new method extends beyond the traditional method of lines framework and utilizes stage-dependent polynomial spaces for the spatial discretization operators. To be more specific, two different DG operators, associated with $\mathcal{P}^k$ and $\mathcal{P}^{k-1}$ piecewise polynomial spaces, are used at different RK stages. The resulting method is referred to as the sdRKDG method. It features fewer floating-point operations and may achieve larger time step sizes. For problems without sonic points, we observe optimal convergence for all the sdRKDG schemes; and for problems with sonic points, we observe that a subset of the sdRKDG schemes remains optimal. We have also conducted von Neumann analysis for the stability and error of the sdRKDG schemes for the linear advection equation in one dimension. Numerical tests, for problems including two-dimensional Euler equations for gas dynamics, are provided to demonstrate the performance of the new method.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 07:18:22 UTC (3,971 KB)"

"12","Learning solution operators of PDEs defined on varying domains via MIONet","Shanshan Xiao, Pengzhan Jin, Yifa Tang","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","In this work, we propose a method to learn the solution operators of PDEs defined on varying domains via MIONet, and theoretically justify this method. We first extend the approximation theory of MIONet to further deal with metric spaces, establishing that MIONet can approximate mappings with multiple inputs in metric spaces. Subsequently, we construct a set consisting of some appropriate regions and provide a metric on this set thus make it a metric space, which satisfies the approximation condition of MIONet. Building upon the theoretical foundation, we are able to learn the solution mapping of a PDE with all the parameters varying, including the parameters of the differential operator, the right-hand side term, the boundary condition, as well as the domain. Without loss of generality, we for example perform the experiments for 2-d Poisson equations, where the domains and the right-hand side terms are varying. The results provide insights into the performance of this method across convex polygons, polar regions with smooth boundary, and predictions for different levels of discretization on one task. Reasonably, we point out that this is a meshless method, hence can be flexibly used as a general solver for a type of PDE.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 05:11:34 UTC (3,804 KB)"

Whilst smooth and triangulated 4-manifolds do coincide, comparatively little work has been done towards gaining an understanding of smooth 4-manifolds from the discrete and algorithmic perspective. In this paper we introduce new software tools to make this possible, including a software implementation of an algorithm which enables us to build triangulations of 4-manifolds from Kirby diagrams, as well as a new heuristic for simplifying 4-manifold triangulations. Using these tools, we present new triangulations of several bounded exotic pairs, corks and plugs (objects responsible for ""exoticity""), as well as the smallest known triangulation of the fundamental K3 surface. The small size of these triangulations benefit us by revealing fine structural features in 4-manifold triangulations.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 04:13:24 UTC (1,564 KB)"
"15","Repro Samples Method for a Performance Guaranteed Inference in General and Irregular Inference Problems","Minge Xie, Peng Wang","Methodology (stat.ME)","Rapid advancements in data science require us to have fundamentally new frameworks to tackle prevalent but highly non-trivial ""irregular"" inference problems, to which the large sample central limit theorem does not apply. Typical examples are those involving discrete or non-numerical parameters and those involving non-numerical data, etc. In this article, we present an innovative, wide-reaching, and effective approach, called ""repro samples method,"" to conduct statistical inference for these irregular problems plus more. The development relates to but improves several existing simulation-inspired inference approaches, and we provide both exact and approximate theories to support our development. Moreover, the proposed approach is broadly applicable and subsumes the classical Neyman-Pearson framework as a special case. For the often-seen irregular inference problems that involve both discrete/non-numerical and continuous parameters, we propose an effective three-step procedure to make inferences for all parameters. We also develop a unique matching scheme that turns the discreteness of discrete/non-numerical parameters from an obstacle for forming inferential theories into a beneficial attribute for improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed general methodology using various examples, including a case study example on a Gaussian mixture model with unknown number of components. This case study example provides a solution to a long-standing open inference question in statistics on how to quantify the estimation uncertainty for the unknown number of components and other associated parameters. Real data and simulation studies, with comparisons to existing approaches, demonstrate the far superior performance of the proposed method.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 22:43:42 UTC (384 KB)"

Because of its importance, it has been approached with the main theoretical and practical tools. Resolution approaches based on Linear Programming are the most effective, while Constraint Programming proves valuable when the Bin Packing Problem is a component of a larger problem. This work focuses on the Bin Packing constraint and explores how GPUs can be used to enhance its propagation algorithm. Two approaches are motivated and discussed, one based on knapsack reasoning and one using alternative lower bounds. The implementations are evaluated in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on different benchmarks from the literature.

"19","On Schrödingerization based quantum algorithms for linear dynamical systems with inhomogeneous terms","S. Jin, N. Liu, C. Ma","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","We analyze the Schrödingerisation method for quantum simulation of a general class of non-unitary dynamics with inhomogeneous source terms. The Schrödingerisation technique, introduced in \cite{JLY22a,JLY23}, transforms any linear ordinary and partial differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into a system under unitary dynamics via a warped phase transition that maps the equations into a higher dimension, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This technique can also be applied to these equations with inhomogeneous terms modeling source or forcing terms or boundary and interface conditions, and discrete dynamical systems such as iterative methods in numerical linear algebra, through extra equations in the system. Difficulty airses with the presense of inhomogeneous terms since it can change the stability of the original system. In this paper, we systematically study--both theoretically and numerically--the important issue of recovering the original variables from the Schrödingerized equations, even when the evolution operator contains unstable modes. We show that even with unstable modes, one can still construct a stable scheme, yet to recover the original variable one needs to use suitable data in the extended space. We analyze and compare both the discrete and continuous Fourier transforms used in the extended dimension, and derive corresponding error estimates, which allows one to use the more appropriate transform for specific equations. We also provide a smoother initialization for the Schrodödingerized system to gain higher order accuracy in the extended space. We homogenize the inhomogeneous terms with a stretch transformation, making it easier to recover the original variable. Our recovering technique also provides a simple and generic framework to solve general ill-posed problems in a computationally stable way.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:49:59 UTC (273 KB)"

The mesh movement, which is prescribed by a discretized dynamical system for the nodal points, follows the direction of convection. It is shown that under a restriction of the time increment the mesh movement cannot lead to an overlap of the elements and therefore an invalid mesh. For the linear element, optimal error estimates in the $\ell^\infty(L^2) \cap \ell^2(H_0^1)$ norm are proved in case of both, a first-order backward Euler method and a second-order two-step method in time. These results are based on new estimates of the time dependent interpolation operator derived in this work. Preservation of the total mass is verified for both choices of the time discretization. Numerical experiments are presented that confirm the error estimates and demonstrate that the proposed moving mesh scheme can circumvent limitations that the Lagrange-Galerkin method on a fixed mesh exhibits.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:46:20 UTC (285 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:04:34 UTC (285 KB)"

Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs.

We prove the equidistribution results which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. Main tools are borrowed from the capacity theory. In the context of random polynomial mappings from $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ to $\mathbb{C}^k$, we prove an equidistribution theorem for various codimensions $1 \leq k \leq m$ by applying the results from the capacity theory along with the codimension $1$ analysis. Based on our current information, this result is general enough to encompass many previous ones in the literature regarding the asymptotic distribution of zeros of random polynomial mappings. We touch upon some well-known probability in this direction.

We start by performing a continuous entropy analysis of the ideal multi-ion MHD system, described by, e.g., Toth (2010) [Multi-Ion Magnetohydrodynamics], which describes the motion of multi-ion plasmas with independent momentum and energy equations for each ion species. Following the continuous entropy analysis, we propose an algebraic manipulation to the multi-ion MHD system, such that entropy consistency can be transferred from the continuous analysis to its discrete approximation. Moreover, we augment the system of equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique to have an additional cleaning mechanism of the magnetic field divergence error. We first derive robust entropy-conservative (EC) fluxes for the alternative formulation of the multi-ion GLM-MHD system that satisfy a Tadmor-type condition and are consistent with existing EC fluxes for single-fluid GLM-MHD equations. Using these numerical two-point fluxes, we construct high-order EC and ES DG discretizations of the ideal multi-ion MHD system using collocated Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The resulting nodal DG schemes satisfy the second-law of thermodynamics at the semi-discrete level, while maintaining high-order convergence and local node-wise conservation properties. We demonstrate the high-order convergence, and the EC and ES properties of our scheme with numerical validation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of the GLM divergence technique and the ES discretization to improve the robustness properties of a DG discretization of the multi-ion MHD system by solving a challenging magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem that exhibits MHD turbulence.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 15:03:38 UTC (7,026 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:18:08 UTC (7,026 KB)"

We employ a continuous-time approximation based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to design multi-year supply curves, a method that stands in contrast to conventional practices which often overlook inter-year transitions and ongoing processes. For medium-term charging station location planning (CSLP), we apply a flow refueling location model (FRLM) within grid-based multi-level networks, considering both multiple-path networks and capacity constraints. The grid-based network planning strategy uses a three-tier (Macro-Meso-Micro) approach for thorough EV charging station placement, with the macro-level covering entire cities, the meso-level assessing detailed EV routes and bridging the macro to micro levels, and the micro-level focusing on precise station placement for accessibility and efficiency. Our investigation into overutilization and underutilization scenarios delivers valuable insights for policymaking and cost-benefit analyses. Illustrating our approach with the example of the Chicago sketch network, we introduce an integrated demand-supply model suitable for a single region and extendable to multiple regions, thereby addressing a gap in the existing literature. Our proposed methodology focuses on EV station placement, taking into account future needs, geographical capacities, and the importance of scenario analysis, which empowers strategic resource planning for EV charging networks over extended timeframes, thus aiding the transition towards a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 04:02:55 UTC (2,003 KB)"

We define a partial order on $\mathbb{R}^{2k}_+$, compatible with the monotonicity of $F$, and then use it to embed the $k$-dimensional system into a $2k$-dimensional system that is monotonic with respect to this poset structure. An analogous construction is given for periodic systems. Using the characteristics of the higher-dimensional monotonic system, global stability results are obtained for the original system. Our results apply to a large class of difference equations that are pertinent in a variety of contexts. As an application of the developed theory, we provide two examples that cover a wide class of difference equations, and in a subsequent paper, we provide additional applications of general interest.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 20:51:57 UTC (25 KB)"
"30","Self-adhesivity in lattices of abstract conditional independence models","Tobias Boege, Janneke H. Bolt, Milan Studený","Combinatorics (math.CO)","We introduce an algebraic concept of the frame for abstract conditional independence (CI) models, together with basic operations with respect to which such a frame should be closed: copying and marginalization. Three standard examples of such frames are (discrete) probabilistic CI structures, semi-graphoids and structural semi-graphoids. We concentrate on those frames which are closed under the operation of set-theoretical intersection because, for these, the respective families of CI models are lattices. This allows one to apply the results from lattice theory and formal concept analysis to describe such families in terms of implications among CI statements. The central concept of this paper is that of self-adhesivity defined in algebraic terms, which is a combinatorial reflection of the self-adhesivity concept studied earlier in context of polymatroids and information theory. The generalization also leads to a self-adhesivity operator defined on the hyper-level of CI frames. We answer some of the questions related to this approach and raise other open questions. The core of the paper is in computations. The combinatorial approach to computation might overcome some memory and space limitation of software packages based on polyhedral geometry, in particular, if SAT solvers are utilized. We characterize some basic CI families over 4 variables in terms of canonical implications among CI statements. We apply our method in information-theoretical context to the task of entropic region demarcation over 5 variables.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 18:59:09 UTC (479 KB)"
"31","Improved Lower Bound on the Number of Pseudoline Arrangements","Justin Dallant","Computational Geometry (cs.CG)","We show that for large enough $n$, the number of non-isomorphic pseudoline arrangements of order $n$ is greater than $2^{c\cdot n^2}$ for some constant $c > 0.2604$, improving the previous best bound of $c>0.2083$ by Dumitrescu and Mandal (2020). Arrangements of pseudolines (and in particular arrangements of lines) are important objects appearing in many forms in discrete and computational geometry. They have strong ties for example with oriented matroids, sorting networks and point configurations. Let $B_n$ be the number of non-isomorphic pseudoline arrangements of order $n$ and let $b_n := \log_2(B_n)$. The problem of estimating $b_n$ dates back to Knuth, who conjectured that $b_n \leq 0.5n^2 + o(n^2)$ and derived the first bounds $n^2/6-O(n) \leq b_n \leq 0.7924(n^2+n)$. Both the upper and the lower bound have been improved a couple of times since. For the upper bound, it was first improved to $b_n < 0.6988n^2$ (Felsner, 1997), then $b_n < 0.6571 n^2$ by Felsner and Valtr (2011), for large enough $n$. In the same paper, Felsner and Valtr improved the constant in the lower bound to $c> 0.1887$, which was subsequently improved by Dumitrescu and Mandal to $c>0.2083$. Our new bound is based on a construction which starts with one of the constructions of Dumitrescu and Mandal and breaks it into constant sized pieces. We then use software to compute the contribution of each piece to the overall number of pseudoline arrangements. This method adds a lot of flexibility to the construction and thus offers many avenues for future tweaks and improvements which could lead to further tightening of the lower bound.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 16:40:31 UTC (747 KB)"
"32","A Uniformly Random Solution to Algorithmic Redistricting","Jin-Yi Cai, Jacob Kruse, Kenneth Mayer, Daniel P. Szabo","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","The process of drawing electoral district boundaries is known as political redistricting. Within this context, gerrymandering is the practice of drawing these boundaries such that they unfairly favor a particular political party, often leading to unequal representation and skewed electoral outcomes. One of the few ways to detect gerrymandering is by algorithmically sampling redistricting plans. Previous methods mainly focus on sampling from some neighborhood of ``realistic' districting plans, rather than a uniform sample of the entire space. We present a deterministic subexponential time algorithm to uniformly sample from the space of all possible $ k $-partitions of a bounded degree planar graph, and with this construct a sample of the entire space of redistricting plans. We also give a way to restrict this sample space to plans that match certain compactness and population constraints at the cost of added complexity. The algorithm runs in $ 2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n)} $ time, although we only give a heuristic implementation. Our method generalizes an algorithm to count self-avoiding walks on a square to count paths that split general planar graphs into $ k $ regions, and uses this to sample from the space of all $ k $-partitions of a planar graph.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 15:20:58 UTC (1,603 KB)"

These infinite-dimensional Lie groups are the closest relatives to compact Lie groups. Here we study unitary representations of these groups from various perspectives. First, we address norm-continuous, also called bounded, representations: they are well-known for simple groups, but the general picture is more complicated. Our first main result is a characterization of the discrete decomposability of all bounded representations in terms of boundedness of the set of coroots. We also show that bounded representations of type II and III exist if the set of coroots is unbounded. Second, we use covariance with respect to a one-parameter group of automorphisms to implement some regularity. Here we develop some perturbation theory based on half Lie groups that reduces matters to the case where a ``maximal torus'' is fixed, so that compatible weight decompositions can be studied. Third, we extend the context to projective representations which are covariant for a one-parameter group of automorphisms. Here important families of representations arise from ``bounded extremal weights'', and for these the corresponding central extensions can be determined explicitly, together with all one-parameter groups for which a covariant extension exists.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:45:58 UTC (58 KB)"

Based on these we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and show that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stablizable and detectable. A tensor-based Newton method is proposed to find numerical solutions of the ARTE. The tensor version of the bounded real lemma is also established. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is conducted. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed theory and algorithms.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 03:03:11 UTC (428 KB)"

"41","Scaling physics-informed hard constraints with mixture-of-experts","Nithin Chalapathi, Yiheng Du, Aditi Krishnapriyan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an ""expert"" through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 22:45:00 UTC (5,018 KB)"
"42","An efficient finite element method for computing the response of a strain-limiting elastic solid containing a v-notch and inclusions","Shylaja G., Kesavulu Naidu V., Venkatesh B., S. M. Mallikarjunaiah","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","Accurate triangulation of the domain plays a pivotal role in computing the numerical approximation of the differential operators. A good triangulation is the one which aids in reducing discretization errors. In a standard collocation technique, the smooth curved domain is typically triangulated with a mesh by taking points on the boundary to approximate them by polygons. However, such an approach often leads to geometrical errors which directly affect the accuracy of the numerical approximation. To restrict such geometrical errors, \textit{isoparametric}, \textit{subparametric}, and \textit{iso-geometric} methods were introduced which allow the approximation of the curved surfaces (or curved line segments). In this paper, we present an efficient finite element method to approximate the solution to the elliptic boundary value problem (BVP), which governs the response of an elastic solid containing a v-notch and inclusions. The algebraically nonlinear constitutive equation along with the balance of linear momentum reduces to second-order quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation. Our approach allows us to represent the complex curved boundaries by smooth \textit{one-of-its-kind} point transformation. The main idea is to obtain higher-order shape functions which enable us to accurately compute the entries in the finite element matrices and vectors. A Picard-type linearization is utilized to handle the nonlinearities in the governing differential equation. The numerical results for the test cases show considerable improvement in the accuracy.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 22:34:06 UTC (842 KB)"

To address this key challenge, our paper introduces simulation techniques tailored for complex, large-scale Markovian queueing networks. We develop two simulation schemes based on Euler approximation, namely the backward and forward schemes. These schemes can accommodate time-varying dynamics and are optimized for efficient implementation using vectorization. Assuming a feedforward queueing network structure, we establish that the two schemes provide stochastic upper and lower bounds for the system state, while the approximation error remains bounded over the simulation horizon. With the recommended choice of time step, we show that our approximation schemes exhibit diminishing asymptotic relative error as the system scales up, while maintaining much lower computational complexity compared to traditional discrete-event simulation and achieving speedups up to tens of thousands times. This study highlights the substantial potential of Euler approximation in simulating large-scale discrete systems.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 17:24:30 UTC (671 KB)"

On particular smooth domains, such as $\mathbb{R}^d$ or complete Riemannian manifolds, the quantization error is known to decay polynomially as the number of points is taken to infinity, provided the measure satisfies an integral condition which controls the amount of mass outside compact sets. On Riemannian manifolds, the existing integral condition involves a quantity measuring the growth of the exponential map, for which the only available estimates are in terms of lower bounds on sectional curvature. In this paper, we provide a more general integral condition for the asymptotics of the quantization error on Riemannian manifolds, given in terms of the growth of the covering numbers of spheres, which is purely metric in nature and concerns only the large-scale growth of the manifold. We further estimate the covering growth of manifolds in two particular cases, namely lower bounds on the Ricci curvature and geometric group actions by a discrete group of isometries. These estimates can themselves generalize beyond manifolds, and hint at a future treatment of asymptotic quantization also on non-smooth metric measure spaces.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:24:24 UTC (413 KB)"

The analogous problem for surfaces with boundary was posed by Fraser and Li in 2014, and it has attracted much attention in recent years, stimulating the development of many new constructions for free boundary minimal surfaces. In this paper, we resolve this problem by showing that any compact orientable surface with boundary can be embedded in $\mathbb{B}^3$ as a free boundary minimal surface with area below $2\pi$. Furthermore, we show that the number of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ of prescribed topology and area below $8\pi$, and the number of free boundary minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^3$ with prescribed topology and area below $2\pi$, grow at least linearly with the genus. This is achieved via a new method for producing minimal surfaces of prescribed topology in low-dimensional balls and spheres, based on the optimization of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues in the presence of a discrete symmetry group. As a key ingredient, we develop new techniques for proving the existence of maximizing metrics, which can be used to resolve the existence problem in many symmetric situations and provide at least partial existence results for classical eigenvalue optimization problems.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:32:47 UTC (3,544 KB)"

However, the parallel implementation of standard MG methods, which are inherently multiplicative, suffers from increasing communication complexity. In such cases, the additive variants of MG methods provide a good alternative due to their inherently parallel nature, although they exhibit slower convergence. This work combines the additive multigrid method with the multipreconditioned conjugate gradient (MPCG) method. In the proposed approach, the MPCG method employs the corrections from the different levels of the MG hierarchy as separate preconditioned search directions. In this approach, the MPCG method updates the current iterate by using the linear combination of the preconditioned search directions, where the optimal coefficients for the linear combination are computed by exploiting the energy norm minimization of the CG method. The idea behind our approach is to combine the $A$-conjugacy of the search directions of the MPCG method and the quasi $H_1$-orthogonality of the corrections from the MG hierarchy.

Under a general setting where the number of responses can tend to infinity, the joint estimator is demonstrated to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, with differing rates of convergence due to the mean regression coefficients being heterogeneous across responses. An iterative estimation procedure is developed to obtain parameter estimates in the required, constrained parameter space. We apply the proposed model to a multivariate abundance dataset comprising overdispersed counts of 38 Carabidae ground beetle species sampled throughout Scotland, along with information about the environmental conditions of each site and the traits of each species. Results show in particular that the relationships between the mean abundances of various beetle species and environmental covariates are different and that beetle total length has statistically important effect in driving the correlations between the species.

Here, we use a discretized version of the Second Vassiliev Invariant for open chains to analyze Langevin Dynamics simulations of untying and strongly confined polymer chains. We demonstrate that the Vassiliev parameter can accurately and efficiently characterize the knotted state of polymers, providing additional information not captured by a single-closure Alexander calculation. We discuss its relative strengths and weaknesses compared to standard techniques, and argue that it is a useful and powerful tool for analyzing polymer knot simulations.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 07:28:12 UTC (1,430 KB)"

"57","On The Fourier Coefficients of High-Dimensional Random Geometric Graphs","Kiril Bangachev, Guy Bresler","Statistics Theory (math.ST)","The random geometric graph $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1}, p)$ is formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d. vectors $\{V_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ uniformly on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and placing an edge between pairs of vertices $i$ and $j$ for which $\langle V_i,V_j\rangle \ge \tau^p_d,$ where $\tau^p_d$ is such that the expected density is $p.$ We study the low-degree Fourier coefficients of the distribution $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1}, p)$ and its Gaussian analogue. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel two-step strategy for bounding Fourier coefficients which we believe is more widely applicable to studying latent space distributions. First, we localize the dependence among edges to few fragile edges. Second, we partition the space of latent vector configurations $(\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1}, p))^{\otimes n}$ based on the set of fragile edges and on each subset of configurations, we define a noise operator acting independently on edges not incident (in an appropriate sense) to fragile edges. We apply the resulting bounds to: 1) Settle the low-degree polynomial complexity of distinguishing spherical and Gaussian random geometric graphs from Erdos-Renyi both in the case of observing a complete set of edges and in the non-adaptively chosen mask $\mathcal{M}$ model recently introduced by [MVW24]; 2) Exhibit a statistical-computational gap for distinguishing $\mathsf{RGG}$ and the planted coloring model [KVWX23] in a regime when $\mathsf{RGG}$ is distinguishable from Erdos-Renyi; 3) Reprove known bounds on the second eigenvalue of random geometric graphs.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 22:55:56 UTC (586 KB)"

In particular, graphs of bounded lettericity have bounded linear clique-width and they are well-quasi-ordered by induced subgraphs. The latter property implies that any hereditary class of graphs of bounded lettericity can be described by finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs. This, in turn, implies, in a non-constructive way, polynomial-time recognition of such classes. However, no constructive algorithms and no specific bounds on the size of forbidden graphs are available up to date. In the present paper, we develop an algorithm that recognizes $n$-vertex graphs of lettericity at most $k$ in time $f(k)n^3$ and show that any minimal graph of lettericity more than $k$ has at most $2^{O(k^2\log k)}$ vertices.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 21:33:01 UTC (27 KB)"

Our algorithm returns also a $(2^{k+1}-1)$-expression for cliquewidth, yielding a $(2^{k+1}-1)$-approximation algorithm for cliquewidth with the same running time. This improves upon the $O_k(n^2)$ time algorithm of Fomin and Korhonen [STOC 2022]. The main ingredient of our algorithm is a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining rank decompositions of bounded width: We give a data structure that for a dynamic $n$-vertex graph $G$ that is updated by edge insertions and deletions maintains a rank decomposition of $G$ of width at most $4k$ under the promise that the rankwidth of $G$ never grows above $k$. The amortized running time of each update is $O_k(2^{\sqrt{\log n} \log \log n})$. The data structure furthermore can maintain whether $G$ satisfies some fixed ${\sf CMSO}_1$ property within the same running time. We also give a framework for performing ``dense'' edge updates inside a given set of vertices $X$, where the new edges inside $X$ are described by a given ${\sf CMSO}_1$ sentence and vertex labels, in amortized $O_k(|X| \cdot 2^{\sqrt{\log n} \log \log n})$ time. Our dynamic algorithm generalizes the dynamic treewidth algorithm of Korhonen, Majewski, Nadara, Pilipczuk, and Sokołowski [FOCS 2023].","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:50:53 UTC (489 KB)"

Using some existing results on ergodic theory of Markov processes, it has been shown that existence of a properly subinvariant function (counterpart of the Lyapunov density in deterministic systems) implies sweeping of a Markov process out of the sets where this function is integrable. Such a function can be used as a certificate of convergence in probability of a stochastic system.

Our approach hinges upon convex-splitting schemes, a tool which is not only pivotal for clarifying the well-posedness of second-order flows, but also yields a versatile array of robust numerical schemes through temporal and spatial discretization. We prove the convergence to stationary points of such schemes in the semi-discrete setting. Further, we establish their convergence to time-continuous solutions as the time-step tends to zero, and perform a comprehensive error analysis in the fully discrete case.

We say that $G$ is conformally rigid if constant edge-weights maximize the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(w)$ of $L_w$ over all $w$, and minimize $\lambda_n(w')$ of $L_{w'}$ over all $w'$, i.e., for all $w,w'$, $$ \lambda_2(w) \leq \lambda_2(1) \leq \lambda_n(1) \leq \lambda_n(w').$$ Conformal rigidity requires an extraordinary amount of symmetry in $G$. Every edge-transitive graph is conformally rigid. We prove that every distance-regular graph, and hence every strongly-regular graph, is conformally rigid. Certain special graph embeddings can be used to characterize conformal rigidity. Cayley graphs can be conformally rigid but need not be, we prove a sufficient criterion. We also find a small set of conformally rigid graphs that do not belong into any of the above categories; these include the Hoffman graph, the crossing number graph 6B and others.

The unified formulation integrates the Navier-Stokes equation with the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equation, effectively capturing flows in both non-porous and porous domains. In contrast to the conventional Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, which solves the velocity and pressure fields as unknown variables, the proposed method employs a monolithic displacement-pressure formulation adopted from the mixed-form updated-Lagrangian finite element method (FEM). To satisfy the discrete inf-sup stability condition, a stabilization strategy based on the variational multiscale method (VMS) is derived and integrated into the proposed formulation. Another distinctive feature is the implementation of blurred interfaces, which facilitate a seamless and stable transition of flows between free and porous domains, as well as across two distinct porous media. The efficacy of the proposed formulation is verified and validated through several benchmark cases in 1D, 2D, and 3D scenarios. Conducted numerical examples demonstrate enhanced accuracy and stability compared to analytical, experimental, and other numerical solutions.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 21:58:24 UTC (31,167 KB)"

More precisely, we suggest the SVD-based solution for the continuous-discrete cubature Kalman filter and design two estimators: (i) the filter based on the traditionally used Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme; (ii) the estimator based on advanced Itô-Taylor expansion for discretizing the underlying stochastic differential equations.

We formulate the problem as an online resource allocation problem with accept/reject decisions, which from a high level can be viewed as an online knapsack problem, with the additional uncertainty of random budget replenishment. We start with general arrival distributions and propose a simple policy that achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such regret rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget buffers. We show that small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings. Our formulation may have wider applications beyond the problem considered in this paper, and our results emphasize how effective policies should be designed to reach a balance between circumventing wrong accept and reducing wrong reject in online resource allocation problems with uncertain budgets.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 02:11:54 UTC (158 KB)"

Due to its additional degrees of freedom, QPFT performs better in applications than other time-frequency analysis methods. Recently, quaternion quadratic phase Fourier (QQPFT), an extension of the QPFT in quaternion algebra, has been derived and since received noticeable attention because of its expressiveness and grace in the analysis of multidimensional quaternion-valued signals and visuals. To the best of our knowledge, the discrete form of the QQPFT is undefined, making it impossible to compute the QQPFT using digital techniques at this time. It initiated us to introduce the two-dimensional (2D) discrete quaternion quadratic phase Fourier (DQQPFT) that is analogous to the 2D discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT). Some fundamental properties including Modulation, the reconstruction formula and the Plancherel theorem of the 2D DQQPFT are obtained. Crucially, the fast computation algorithm and convolution theorem of 2D DQQPFT which are essential for engineering applications are also taken into account.

Such approach, however, has failed to address the estimation problem for continuous-discrete models. In this paper, we develop a novel continuous-discrete derivative-free EKF methodology by deriving the related moment differential equations (MDEs) and sample point differential equations (SPDEs). Additionally, we derive their Cholesky-based square-root MDEs and SPDEs and obtain several numerically stable derivative-free EKF methods. Finally, we propose the MATLAB-oriented implementations for all continuous-discrete derivative-free EKF algorithms derived. They are easy to implement because of the built-in fashion of the MATLAB numerical integrators utilized for solving either the MDEs or SPDEs in use, which are the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). More importantly, these are accurate derivative-free EKF implementations because any built-in MATLAB ODE solver includes the discretization error control that bounds the discretization error arisen and makes the implementation methods accurate. Besides, this is done in automatic way and no extra coding is required from users. The new filters are particularly effective for working with stochastic systems with highly nonlinear and/or nondifferentiable drift and observation functions, i.e. when the calculation of Jacobian matrices are either problematical or questionable.

We recover the same form as HiSD from this scheme, which not only leads to error estimates naturally, but indicates that the mechanism of Stiefel manifold preservation by Lagrangian multiplier terms in HiSD is nearly a Gram-Schmidt process (such that the above modification is appropriate). The developed methods are further extended to analyze the more complicated constrained HiSD on high-dimensional sphere, which reveals more mechanisms of the constrained HiSD in preserving several manifold properties.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 13:40:54 UTC (258 KB)"

This condition is known to be satisfied for any graph class with bounded tree-independence number, a graph parameter introduced independently by Yolov in 2018 and by Dallard, Milanič, and Štorgel in 2024.

Most previous studies depend on locally linearizing either the PDE system or its discretized numerical counterpart. This involves conducting a linear stability analysis for a trivial solution or utilizing Newton-Raphson iteration on the force residual equations derived from finite element approximation, respectively. The paper presents a numerical approach that frames the search for solutions as the optimization of a discretized energy functional, similar to Tallinen et al., PRL, 2013. In contrast to Tallinen et al., we utilize the Hessian matrix of the energy to develop a gradient descent algorithm that ensures energy stability, which allows us to search solutions robustly in different types of bifurcations. The solutions are further refined locally by Newton-Raphson iterations. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by studying shape transitions induced by the growth in the interior layer of a bilayer annulus, with the outer layer constrained at its outermost boundary. By investigating three cases with varying elastic-moduli ratios between the two layers, we illustrate that our new method can not only identify and characterize supercritical bifurcations leading to smooth wrinkles but also capture subcritical transitions from smooth solutions to non-smooth crease-forming solutions.

The investigation focuses on an Inverted Multi-element Wing in Ground Effect (i.e. 2.5D Imperial Front Wing section) representing a Formula 1 front wing, and compares the strengths and limitations of the two LES methods. The explicit LES formulation relies on the Vreman model, that adapts to laminar, transitional and turbulent regimes. The numerical formulation uses nodal basis functions and Gauss points. The implicit LES formulation, does not require explicit turbulence modeling but relies in the discretization scheme. We use the Kennedy-Gruber entropy stable formulation to enhance stability in under resolved simulations, since we recover the continuous properties such as entropy conservation at a discrete level. This formulation employs Gauss-Lobatto points, which downgrades the accuracy of integration but allows for larger time steps in explicit time integration. We compare our results to Nektar++ [1] showing that both LES techniques provide results that agree well with the reference values. The implicit LES shows to better capture transition and allows for larger time steps at a similar cost per iteration. We conclude that this implicit LES formulation is very attractive for complex simulations.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:59:13 UTC (37,480 KB)"

This method allows us to rephrase Gamma Conjecture $1$ in certain situations to an Apéry-like discrete limit. We use this to give a simple proof of Gamma Conjecture $1$ for projective spaces.

One of the simplest examples of such asymptotically isospectral periodic graphs is the square lattice perturbed by long edges and the cubic lattice. We also get asymptotics of the endpoints of the spectral bands for the Schrödinger operator on the perturbed graph as the length of the added edges tends to infinity.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 16:03:24 UTC (80 KB)"

The MAC scheme is reformulated as a mixed finite element method on a staggered grid, which allows for the proposed scheme to be analyzed as a mortar mixed finite element method. We show that the discrete system is well-posed and derive a priori error estimates that indicate first order convergence in all variables.

Using examples of compositional poromechanics with application to geological CO$_2$ sequestration, we see that solutions obtained using the fixed-stress scheme with a low order finite element-finite volume discretization which is not inherently inf-sup stable can exhibit the same pressure oscillations obtained with the corresponding fully implicit scheme. Moreover, pressure jump stabilization can effectively remove these spurious oscillations in the fixed-stress setting, while also improving the efficiency of the scheme in terms of the number of iterations required at every time step to reach convergence.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 06:21:02 UTC (5,973 KB)"

The key to our analysis of Langevin MCMC is a bound on the discretization error of the geometric Euler-Murayama scheme, assuming $\nabla h$ is Lipschitz and $M$ has bounded sectional curvature. Our error bound matches the error of Euclidean Euler-Murayama in terms of its stepsize dependence. Combined with a contraction guarantee for the geometric Langevin Diffusion under Kendall-Cranston coupling, we prove that the Langevin MCMC iterates lie within $\epsilon$-Wasserstein distance of $\pi^*$ after $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps, which matches the iteration complexity for Euclidean Langevin MCMC. Our results apply in general settings where $h$ can be nonconvex and $M$ can have negative Ricci curvature. Under additional assumptions that the Riemannian curvature tensor has bounded derivatives, and that $\pi^*$ satisfies a $CD(\cdot,\infty)$ condition, we analyze the stochastic gradient version of Langevin MCMC, and bound its iteration complexity by $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ as well.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 22:59:14 UTC (96 KB)"

These bases provide multilevel splittings of the temporal discretization spaces into ""increment"" or ""detail"" spaces of direct sum type. Via algebraic tensor-products of these temporal multilevel discretizations with standard, hierarchic finite element spaces in the spatial domain (with standard Lagrangian FE bases), sparse space-time tensor-product spaces are obtained, which afford a substantial reduction in the number of the degrees of freedom as compared to time-marching discretizations. In addition, temporal spline-wavelet bases allow to compress certain nonlocal integrodifferential operators which appear in stable space-time variational formulations of initial-boundary value problems, such as the heat equation and the acoustic wave equation. An efficient preconditioner is proposed that affords linear complexity solves of the linear system of equations which results from the sparse space-time Galerkin discretization.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 22:29:07 UTC (206 KB)"

In response to these challenges, we are exploring the potential of twin robotic CT systems, which offer the flexibility to acquire projections from arbitrary views around the object of interest. Ensuring complete and mathematically sound reconstructions becomes critical in such systems. In this work, we present an integer programming-based CT trajectory optimization method. Utilizing discrete data completeness conditions, we formulate an optimization problem to select an optimized set of projections. This approach enforces data completeness and considers absorption-based metrics for reliability evaluation. We compare our method with an equidistant circular CT trajectory and a greedy approach. While greedy already performs well in some cases, we provide a way to improve greedy-based projection selection using an integer optimization approach.

Specific examples of the problems we consider include the dynamic formulation of the p-Wasserstein metric, optimal transport around an obstacle, and measure transport subject to acceleration controls. Unlike existing numerical approaches, our particle method is meshfree and does not require global knowledge of an underlying cost function or of the terminal constraint. A key feature of our approach is a novel way of enforcing the terminal constraint via a soft, nonlocal approximation, inspired by recent work on blob methods for diffusion equations. We prove convergence of our particle approximation to solutions of the continuum mean-field control problem in the sense of Gamma-convergence. A byproduct of our result is an extension of existing discrete-to-continuum convergence results for mean field control problems to more general state and measure costs, as arise when modeling transport around obstacles, and more general constraint sets, including controllable linear time invariant systems. Finally, we conclude by implementing our method numerically and using it to compute solutions the example problems discussed above.

When used as priors for the vector of parameters in general probit, tobit, and multinomial probit models, these distributions yield posteriors that still belong to the SUN family. Although such a core result has led to important advancements in Bayesian inference and computation, its applicability beyond likelihoods associated with fully-observed, discretized, or censored realizations from multivariate Gaussian models remains yet unexplored. This article covers such an important gap by proving that the wider family of multivariate unified skew-elliptical (SUE) distributions, which extends SUNs to more general perturbations of elliptical densities, guarantees conjugacy for broader classes of models, beyond those relying on fully-observed, discretized or censored Gaussians. Such a result leverages the closure under linear combinations, conditioning and marginalization of SUE to prove that such a family is conjugate to the likelihood induced by general multivariate regression models for fully-observed, censored or dichotomized realizations from skew-elliptical distributions. This advancement substantially enlarges the set of models that enable conjugate Bayesian inference to general formulations arising from elliptical and skew-elliptical families, including the multivariate Student's t and skew-t, among others.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 09:59:23 UTC (40 KB)"

Specifically, we study the resulting discrete-time dynamics in a class of parametrized congestion games, and we show that (i) in the biological model of intra-species competition, the dynamics remain convergent for any parameter value; (ii) the dynamics of pairwise proportional imitation for different equilibrium configurations exhibit an entire range of behaviors for large step size (stability, instability, and even Li-Yorke chaos); while (iii) for the exponential / multiplicative weights (EW) algorithm increasing step size will (almost) inevitably lead to chaos (again, in the formal, Li-Yorke sense). This divergence of behaviors comes in stark contrast to the globally convergent behavior of the replicator dynamics, and serves to delineate the extent to which the replicator dynamics provide a useful predictor for the long-run behavior of their discrete-time origins.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 09:40:34 UTC (396 KB)"

Phase space engineering technologies utilizing externally injected electromagnetic fields can be applied to meet the challenge of maintaining non-thermal particle distributions at a reasonable cost. The physical processes of the phase space engineering are studied from a theoretical and algorithmic perspective. It is emphasized that the operational space of phase space engineering is limited by the underpinning symplectic dynamics of charged particles. The phase space incompressibility according to the Liouville theorem is just one of many constraints, and Gromov's non-squeezing theorem determines the minimum footprints of the charged particles on every conjugate phase space plane. In this sense and level of sophistication, the mathematical abstraction of phase space engineering is symplectic topology. To simulate the processes of phase space engineering, such as the Maxwell demon and electromagnetic energy extraction, and to accurately calculate the minimum footprints of charged particles, recently developed structure-preserving geometric algorithms can be used. The family of algorithms conserves exactly, on discretized spacetime, symplecticity and thus incompressibility, non-squeezability, and symplectic capacities. The algorithms apply to the dynamics of charged particles under the influence of external electromagnetic fields as well as the charged particle-electromagnetic field system governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 23:56:52 UTC (648 KB)"

In a fully model-free problem setting, this computation can only be approximated by state samples collected at discrete time points using computational methods such as the canonical Euler-Maruyama method. Our research reveals a critical phenomenon: the sampling period can significantly impact control performance. This impact is due to the fact that computational errors introduced in each step of PI can significantly affect the algorithm's convergence behavior, which in turn influences the resulting control policy. We draw a parallel between PI and Newton's method applied to the Ricatti equation to elucidate how the computation impacts control. In this light, the computational error in each PI step manifests itself as an extra error term in each step of Newton's method, with its upper bound proportional to the computational error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convergence rate for ADP in stochastic LQR problems using the Euler-Maruyama method is O(h), with h being the sampling period.

"112","Multi-Hierarchical Surrogate Learning for Structural Dynamical Crash Simulations Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks","Jonas Kneifl, Jörg Fehr, Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Crash simulations play an essential role in improving vehicle safety, design optimization, and injury risk estimation. Unfortunately, numerical solutions of such problems using state-of-the-art high-fidelity models require significant computational effort. Conventional data-driven surrogate modeling approaches create low-dimensional embeddings for evolving the dynamics in order to circumvent this computational effort. Most approaches directly operate on high-resolution data obtained from numerical discretization, which is both costly and complicated for mapping the flow of information over large spatial distances. Furthermore, working with a fixed resolution prevents the adaptation of surrogate models to environments with variable computing capacities, different visualization resolutions, and different accuracy requirements. We thus propose a multi-hierarchical framework for structurally creating a series of surrogate models for a kart frame, which is a good proxy for industrial-relevant crash simulations, at different levels of resolution. For multiscale phenomena, macroscale features are captured on a coarse surrogate, whereas microscale effects are resolved by finer ones. The learned behavior of the individual surrogates is passed from coarse to finer levels through transfer learning. In detail, we perform a mesh simplification on the kart model to obtain multi-resolution representations of it. We then train a graph-convolutional neural network-based surrogate that learns parameter-dependent low-dimensional latent dynamics on the coarsest representation. Subsequently, another, similarly structured surrogate is trained on the residual of the first surrogate using a finer resolution. This step can be repeated multiple times. By doing so, we construct multiple surrogates for the same system with varying hardware requirements and increasing accuracy.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 15:22:59 UTC (4,213 KB)[v2] Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:10:45 UTC (4,193 KB)"
"113","The Boosted Difference of Convex Functions Algorithm for Value-at-Risk Constrained Portfolio Optimization","Marah-Lisanne Thormann, Phan Tu Vuong, Alain B. Zemkoho","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","A highly relevant problem of modern finance is the design of Value-at-Risk (VaR) optimal portfolios. Due to contemporary financial regulations, banks and other financial institutions are tied to use the risk measure to control their credit, market and operational risks. For a portfolio with a discrete return distribution and finitely many scenarios, a Difference of Convex (DC) functions representation of the VaR can be derived. Wozabal (2012) showed that this yields a solution to a VaR constrained Markowitz style portfolio selection problem using the Difference of Convex Functions Algorithm (DCA). A recent algorithmic extension is the so-called Boosted Difference of Convex Functions Algorithm (BDCA) which accelerates the convergence due to an additional line search step. It has been shown that the BDCA converges linearly for solving non-smooth quadratic problems with linear inequality constraints. In this paper, we prove that the linear rate of convergence is also guaranteed for a piecewise linear objective function with linear equality and inequality constraints using the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property. An extended case study under consideration of best practices for comparing optimization algorithms demonstrates the superiority of the BDCA over the DCA for real-world financial market data. We are able to show that the results of the BDCA are significantly closer to the efficient frontier compared to the DCA. Due to the open availability of all data sets and code, this paper further provides a practical guide for transparent and easily reproducible comparisons of VaR constrained portfolio selection problems in Python.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 14:18:14 UTC (287 KB)"
"114","Invariants of persistence modules defined by order-embeddings","Claire Amiot, Thomas Brüstle, Eric J. Hanson","Algebraic Topology (math.AT)","One of the main objectives of topological data analysis is the study of discrete invariants for persistence modules, in particular when dealing with multiparameter persistence modules. In many cases, the invariants studied for these non-totally ordered posets $P$ can be obtained from restricting a given module to a subposet $X$ of $P$ that is totally ordered (or more generally, of finite representation type), and then computing the barcode (or the general direct sum decomposition) over $X$. We consider in this paper general order-preserving embeddings of representation-finite subposets $X$ into $P$ and study systematically the invariants obtained by decomposing the restriction of a given $P$-module $M$ to $X$ into its indecomposable summands. The restriction functor from $\mathrm{mod} \ P$ to $\mathrm{mod} \ X$ is well-studied, and it is known to be exact and admits both left and right adjoint functors, known as induction and co-induction functors. This allows us to obtain new homological insights, and also to re-interpret previous results. We use this approach also to determine bases, thus generalizing the concept of signed barcodes which is considered in the literature in relation to stability results. It turns out that considering only order-embeddings of one fixed poset $X$ into the poset $P$, and studying the set of all indecomposables obtained from $X$ introduces a lot of redundancy. We therefore also study iterated embeddings of several posets of increasing sizes, while limiting attention to only some indecomposables (that have not been obtained from embedding of smaller posets previously).","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 14:10:02 UTC (27 KB)"

We prove that if k cops have a winning strategy in this game, then k cops have a monotone winning strategy. As a corollary we obtain a new characterisation of bounded depth treewidth, and we give a positive answer to an open question by Fluck, Seppelt and Spitzer (2024), thus showing that graph classes of bounded depth treewidth are homomorphism distinguishing closed. Our proof of monotonicity substantially reorganises a winning strategy by first transforming it into a pre-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then applying an intricate breadth-first ""cleaning up"" procedure along the pre-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy), in order to achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of cop placements simultaneously across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument. We believe this can be useful in future research.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 12:39:17 UTC (183 KB)"

Further we examine the joint behavior of two random sums, under generalized tail asymptotic independence.

Many natural equivalence relations comparing graphs such as (quantum) isomorphism, cospectrality, and logical equivalences can be characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability relations over various graph classes. For a fixed graph class $\mathcal{F}$, the decision problem HomInd($\mathcal{F}$) asks to determine whether two input graphs $G$ and $H$ are homomorphism indistinguishable over $\mathcal{F}$. The problem HomInd($\mathcal{F}$) is known to be decidable only for few graph classes $\mathcal{F}$. We show that HomInd($\mathcal{F}$) admits a randomised polynomial-time algorithm for every graph class $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded treewidth which is definable in counting monadic second-order logic CMSO2. Thereby, we give the first general algorithm for deciding homomorphism indistinguishability. This result extends to a version of HomInd where the graph class $\mathcal{F}$ is specified by a CMSO2-sentence and a bound $k$ on the treewidth, which are given as input. For fixed $k$, this problem is randomised fixed-parameter tractable. If $k$ is part of the input then it is coNP- and coW[1]-hard. Addressing a problem posed by Berkholz (2012), we show coNP-hardness by establishing that deciding indistinguishability under the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm is coNP-hard when $k$ is part of the input.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 07:10:57 UTC (33 KB)"

This establishes rigorously that the cluster size at the origin in these models exhibits critical speeding-up. The proofs involve controlling relevant Fourier coefficients. In the case of binary trees, these Fourier coefficients are studied explicitly, while for high-dimensional tori we employ a randomised algorithm argument introduced by Schramm and Steif in the context of noise sensitivity.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 03:58:18 UTC (24 KB)"

This problem is strongly NP-hard, NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor, and optimal solutions can be irrational. In our main result we show that an arbitrarily good solution can be found in polynomial time, if we fix the number of integer variables. This algorithm provides a natural extension to the mixed integer setting, of the polynomial solvability of the trust region problem proven by Ye, Karmarkar, Vavasis, and Zippel. Our result removes a key bottleneck in the design and analysis of model trust region methods for mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. The techniques introduced to prove this result are of independent interest and can be used in other mixed integer programming problems involving quadratic functions. As an example we consider the problem of minimizing a general quadratic function over the mixed integer points in a polyhedron. For this problem, we show that a solution satisfying weak bounds with respect to optimality can be computed in polynomial time, provided that the number of integer variables is fixed. It is well-known that finding a solution satisfying stronger bounds cannot be done in polynomial time, unless P=NP.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 22:13:18 UTC (45 KB)"

Using the direct method, we compute the point symmetry pseudogroup of this equation and analyze its structure. In particular, we single out its essential subgroup and classify its discrete elements. We exhaustively classify all subalgebras of the corresponding essential Lie invariance algebra up to inner automorphisms and up to the action of the essential point-symmetry group. This allowed us to classify Lie reductions and Lie invariant solutions of the equation under consideration. We also discuss the generation of its solutions using point and linear generalized symmetries and carry out its peculiar generalized reductions. As a result, we construct wide families of its solutions parameterized by an arbitrary finite number of arbitrary solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation or one or two arbitrary solutions of (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equations with inverse square potentials.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 22:05:22 UTC (35 KB)"

This condition forms the cornerstone of a method that finds nearly minimal or minimal edge colorings of infinite lattice graphs. In case a nearly minimal edge coloring is requested, the running time is $O(\mu^2 D^4)$, where $\mu$ is the number of edges in one cell (or `basis graph') of the lattice graph and $D$ is the maximum distance between two cells so that there is an edge from within one cell to the other. In case a minimal edge coloring is requested, we lack an upper bound on the running time, which we find need not pose a limitation in practice; we use the method to minimal edge color the meshes of all $k$-uniform tilings of the plane for $k\leq 6$, while utilizing modest computational resources. We find that all these lattice graphs are Vizing class~I. Relating edge colorings to quantum circuits, our work finds direct application by offering minimal-depth quantum circuits in the areas of quantum simulation, quantum optimization, and quantum state verification.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 19:38:58 UTC (220 KB)"

Using entropic optimal transport kernels, we model a class of hypothesis spaces of density functions over which the inference functional can be minimized. This hypothesis class is particularly suited for approximate inference of transfer operators from data. We solve the resulting discrete minimization problem by a modification of the EMML algorithm to take addional transition probability constraints into account and prove the convergence of this algorithm.

One dimensional limiting is a commonly employed technique used to suppress nonphysical oscillations. However, the application of such limiters can reduce accuracy. It is important to identify the weakest set of sufficient conditions required on the limiter as to allow the development of successful numerical algorithms. The main goal of this paper is to identify new less restrictive sufficient conditions for flux form in-compressible advection to remain monotonic. First, we identify conditions in which the Spekreijse limiter region can fail to be monotonic for incompressible flux form advection and demonstrate this numerically. Then a convex combination argument is used to derive new sufficient conditions that are less restrictive than the Sweby region for a discrete maximum principle. This allows the introduction of two new more general limiter regions suitable for flux form incompressible advection.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 11:42:12 UTC (748 KB)"

Such approximation polynomials come from a discretization of filtered Fourier--Laguerre partial sums, which are filtered by using a de la Vallée Poussin (VP) filter. They have the peculiarity of depending on two parameters: a truncation parameter that determines how many of the $n$ Laguerre zeros are considered, and a localization parameter, which determines the range of action of the VP filter that we are going to apply. As $n\to\infty$, under simple assumptions on such parameters and on the Laguerre exponents of the involved weights, we prove that the new VP filtered approximation polynomials have uniformly bounded Lebesgue constants and uniformly convergence at a near--best approximation rate, for any locally continuous function on the semiaxis. \newline The theoretical results have been validated by the numerical experiments. In particular, they show a better performance of the proposed VP filtered approximation versus the truncated Lagrange interpolation at the same nodes, especially for functions a.e. very smooth with isolated singularities. In such cases we see a more localized approximation as well as a good reduction of the Gibbs phenomenon.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 10:38:35 UTC (253 KB)"

The decision procedure is easily implemented in the free software Walnut.

This yields a description of the quantum walk dynamics as simply applying a Chebyshev polynomial to the random walk transition matrix. This perspective decouples the problem from its quantum origin, and highlights connections to earlier (non-quantum) work and the use of Chebyshev polynomials in random walk theory as in the Varopoulos-Carne bound. We illustrate the approach by proving a weak limit of the quantum walk dynamics on the lattice.

"142","Novel definition and quantitative analysis of branch structure with topological data analysis","Haruhisa Oda, Mayuko Kida, Yoichi Nakata, Hiroki Kurihara","Algebraic Topology (math.AT)","While branching network structures abound in nature, their objective analysis is more difficult than expected because existing quantitative methods often rely on the subjective judgment of branch structures. This problem is particularly pronounced when dealing with images comprising discrete particles. Here we propose an objective framework for quantitative analysis of branching networks by introducing the mathematical definitions for internal and external structures based on topological data analysis, specifically, persistent homology. We compare persistence diagrams constructed from images with and without plots on the convex hull. The unchanged points in the two diagrams are the internal structures and the difference between the two diagrams is the external structures. We construct a mathematical theory for our method and show that the internal structures have a monotonicity relationship with respect to the plots on the convex hull, while the external structures do not. This is the phenomenon related to the resolution of the image. Our method can be applied to a wide range of branch structures in biology, enabling objective analysis of numbers, spatial distributions, sizes, and more. Additionally, our method has the potential to be combined with other tools in topological data analysis, such as the generalized persistence landscape.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 06:32:00 UTC (1,109 KB)"

Let $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ be irreducible Arthur type representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ and $\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(F)$ respectively. We study Ext branching laws when $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are products of discrete series representations and their Aubert-Zelevinsky duals. We obtain an Ext analogue of the local non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture in this case.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 05:58:31 UTC (23 KB)"
"144","Computing discrete residues of rational functions","Carlos E. Arreche, Hari P. Sitaula","Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)","In 2012 Chen and Singer introduced the notion of discrete residues for rational functions as a complete obstruction to rational summability. More explicitly, for a given rational function f(x), there exists a rational function g(x) such that f(x) = g(x+1) - g(x) if and only if every discrete residue of f(x) is zero. Discrete residues have many important further applications beyond summability: to creative telescoping problems, thence to the determination of (differential-)algebraic relations among hypergeometric sequences, and subsequently to the computation of (differential) Galois groups of difference equations. However, the discrete residues of a rational function are defined in terms of its complete partial fraction decomposition, which makes their direct computation impractical due to the high complexity of completely factoring arbitrary denominator polynomials into linear factors. We develop a factorization-free algorithm to compute discrete residues of rational functions, relying only on gcd computations and linear algebra.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 23:28:31 UTC (20 KB)"
"145","Adaptive Voronoi-based Column Selection Methods for Interpretable Dimensionality Reduction","Maria Emelianenko, Guy B. Oldaker IV","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","In data analysis, there continues to be a need for interpretable dimensionality reduction methods whereby instrinic meaning associated with the data is retained in the reduced space. Standard approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) fail at this task. A popular alternative is the CUR decomposition. In an SVD-like manner, the CUR decomposition approximates a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ as $A \approx CUR$, where $C$ and $R$ are matrices whose columns and rows are selected from the original matrix \cite{goreinov1997theory}, \cite{mahoney2009cur}. The difficulty in constructing a CUR decomposition is in determining which columns and rows to select when forming $C$ and $R$. Current column/row selection algorithms, particularly those that rely on an SVD, become infeasible as the size of the data becomes large \cite{dong2021simpler}. We address this problem by reducing the column/row selection problem to a collection of smaller sub-problems. The basic idea is to first partition the rows/columns of a matrix, and then apply an existing selection algorithm on each piece; for illustration purposes we use the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (\textsf{DEIM}) \cite{sorensen2016deim}. For the first task, we consider two existing algorithms that construct a Voronoi Tessellation (VT) of the rows and columns of a given matrix. We then extend these methods to automatically adapt to the data. The result is four data-driven row/column selection methods that are well-suited for parallelization, and compatible with nearly any existing column/row selection strategy. Theory and numerical examples show the design to be competitive with the original \textsf{DEIM} routine.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 23:14:56 UTC (58 KB)"
"146","Optimization in SciML -- A Function Space Perspective","Johannes Müller, Marius Zeinhofer","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","We provide an infinite-dimensional view on optimization problems encountered in scientific machine learning (SciML) and advocate for the paradigm first optimize, then discretize for their solution. This amounts to first choosing an appropriate infinite-dimensional algorithm which is then discretized in a second step. To illustrate this point, we discuss recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithms for SciML applications and see that they can be derived within this framework. Hence, this perspective allows for a principled guide for the design of optimization algorithms for SciML. As the infinite-dimensional viewpoint is presently underdeveloped we formalize it here to foster the development of novel optimization algorithms.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 22:13:24 UTC (77 KB)"
"147","On the convergence of the graph sequence $\left\{ C^m(D) \right\}_{m=1}^{\infty}$ for a multipartite tournament $D$","Ji-Hwan Jung, Suh-Ryung Kim, Hyesun Yoon","Combinatorics (math.CO)","Given a positive integer $m$, the $m$-step competition graph of a digraph $D$, denoted by $C^m(D)$, has the same vertex set as $D$ and has an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ if and only if there exists a vertex $w$ such that there exist directed walks of length $m$ from $u$ to $w$ and from $v$ to $w$, respectively. In this paper, we completely characterize the convergence of $\{C^m(D)\}_{m=1}^{\infty}$ for a multipartite tournament $D$ based on the last nontrivial strong component of $D$. Furthermore, not only do we determine the limit in the case of convergence, but also in the event of divergence, we specify how $C^m(D)$ changes periodically depending on the value of $m$. Our results extend the work of Jung et al. [On the limit of the sequence $\{C^m (D)\}_{m=1}^{\infty}$ for a multipartite tournament $D$. Discrete Appl. Math., 340:1--13, 2023] which addresses the case of the last strong component being nontrivial, thereby completing the convergence analysis of $\{C^m(D)\}_{m=1}^{\infty}$ for a multipartite tournament $D$. Our results can also be expressed in terms of matrix sequence $\{A^m(A^T)^m\}_{m=1}^{\infty}$ for the adjacency matrix $A$ of $D$ and this part is also covered in the text.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 13:30:24 UTC (19 KB)"
"148","A hybrid iterative method based on MIONet for PDEs: Theory and numerical examples","Jun Hu, Pengzhan Jin","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","We propose a hybrid iterative method based on MIONet for PDEs, which combines the traditional numerical iterative solver and the recent powerful machine learning method of neural operator, and further systematically analyze its theoretical properties, including the convergence condition, the spectral behavior, as well as the convergence rate, in terms of the errors of the discretization and the model inference. We show the theoretical results for the frequently-used smoothers, i.e. Richardson (damped Jacobi) and Gauss-Seidel. We give an upper bound of the convergence rate of the hybrid method w.r.t. the model correction period, which indicates a minimum point to make the hybrid iteration converge fastest. Several numerical examples including the hybrid Richardson (Gauss-Seidel) iteration for the 1-d (2-d) Poisson equation are presented to verify our theoretical results, and also reflect an excellent acceleration effect. As a meshless acceleration method, it is provided with enormous potentials for practice applications.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 11:02:25 UTC (432 KB)"
"149","A multitype Galton-Watson model for rejuvenating cells","Serik Sagitov, Lotta Eriksson, Marija Cvijovic","Probability (math.PR)","We employ the framework of multitype Galton-Watson processes to model a population of dividing cells. The cellular type is represented by its biological age, defined as the count of harmful proteins in the cell body. The stochastic evolution of the biological age of a generic cell is modeled as a discrete Markov chain with a finite set of states $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, where $n$ signifies the absorbing state corresponding to the senescence state of the cell. In our setting, cells may undergo rejuvenation events when they transmit sufficiently many proteins to their offspring. Consequently, the set of individual types in the multitype Galton-Watson process becomes $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$. For the proposed model, we define and study several biologically meaningful characteristics, including rejuvenating states, expected replicative lifespan, population growth rate, and the average biological age.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 05:50:39 UTC (234 KB)"
"150","Transport multi-paths with capacity constraints","Qinglan Xia, Haotian Sun","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","This article generalizes the study of branched/ramified optimal transportation to those with capacity constraints. Each admissible transport network studied here is represented by a transport multi-path between measures, with a capacity constraint on each of its components. The associated transport cost is given by the sum of the $\textbf{M}_{\alpha}$-cost of each component. Using this new formulation, we prove the existence of an optimal solution and provide an upper bound on the number of components for the solution. Additionally, we conduct analytical examinations of the properties (e.g. ``map-compatibility"", and ``simple common-source property"") of each solution component and explore the interplay among components, particularly in the discrete case.","Sun, 11 Feb 2024 05:15:46 UTC (21 KB)"
